# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./project%20requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## 🌍 Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. 😫 So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, cutie builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-social-proof) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-single-price-grid).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! 🥳 I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://helpful-alpaca-c9c4a9.netlify.app/).
