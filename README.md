# Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section

![Design preview for the Testimonials grid section coding challenge](./project%20requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## üåç Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. üò´ So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, cutie builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-social-proof) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-single-price-grid).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! ü•≥ I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://helpful-alpaca-c9c4a9.netlify.app/).

## ü§î Reflection

This grid is lovely! I had a lot of fun putting this component together. I started with the mobile version, as usual, which was pretty straight forward. I used grid to arrange the elements within the component in a single column.

In the larger screen view, the grid is more complex, and I'm happy to report that I arranged the elements within the grid without a lot of trial and error. It feels nice to be building fluency with vanilla CSS, for sure.

With this build and [the previous one](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-social-proof), I spent a good amount of time tweaking margins and padding of the various elements to make everything align with the images from the brief. There's still a bit of work that could be done to really make the build seamless in this regard, but I think it's pretty close without having the specific text sizes and such from a Figma file.
